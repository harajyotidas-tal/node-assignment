Write a REST API.
This API should accept a number and API response should be 'true' if the given number is a Two-sided Prime (https://prime-numbers.info/article/two-sided-primes), otherwise 'false'.
A number is a Two-sided Prime if 
1.	The number is itself a prime number. 
e.g. 3797
2.	Removing 1 digit at a time from left hand side from the original number gives you prime numbers. 
e.g. 797, 97, 7 are all prime numbers.
3.	Removing 1 digit at a time from right hand side from the original number gives you prime numbers. 
e.g. 379, 37, 3 are all prime numbers.
